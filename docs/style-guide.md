# Documentation Style Guide

The docs in this repo are enforced by this style guide. The purpose of this guide is to make sure the documentation is easily readable by all levels of developers. Derived from the Electron project [documentation](https://github.com/electron/electron/tree/master/docs) process.

## Rules

- A _Documentation Page_ is a markdown document containing one or many hierarchical definitions for the top-level objects exported by Undici.
- A _Definition_ should describe the object as it would be consumed by an user. It should **not** describe internal properties or methods.
- A _Class Definition_ should start with the syntax `# Class: <ClassName>`
